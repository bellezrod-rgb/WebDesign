		<h3>Read about Shawn's <strong>On The Road Again</strong> Tour!</h3>
		<p>On The Road Again is the fifth concert tour by Canadian singer Shawn Mendes, in support of his fifth studio album Shawn (2024)[1]. The tour is set to begin in Pristina, Kosovo at the Sunny Hill Festival on August 2, 2025, and will conclude in Los Angeles, United States at the Hollywood Bowl on October 17.
		Following an intimate, fan-focused For Friends and Family Only Tour supporting his fifth studio album Shawn (released November 15, 2024), Shawn Mendes announced a full-scale comeback with the On The Road Again Tour on May 29, 2025[2]. This tour not only promotes his latest album but also commemorates 10 years since his debut album Handwritten.</p>
		<p>Following the cancellation of his 2022 Wonder Tour to prioritize his mental health - including releasing Shawn during his recovery - this tour marks a meaningful return to large-scale performances. The tour consists of 20 shows: a European leg in August 2025, and a North American leg from August to mid-October 2025. European support acts include MARO and Lubiana, while Eddie Benjamin joins for all North American dates. Ticket sales were structured with presales starting June 4, 2025, followed by general public sales on June 6, 2025 - both beginning at 10 a.m. local time. Tour production is being managed by Live Nation, signaling a return to major arena and festival stages after the more intimate previous outing.</p>
